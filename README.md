# Weekly Task Tracker (7-day pies)

A colorful, themeable 7-day task tracker. Each day shows a pie that fills as tasks are completed. Tasks persist in your browser via localStorage. Mobile layout included.

Highlights
- 7 day cards with per-task slices inside a pie
- Subtasks with auto-completion
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Weekly summary (totals, best day, mini bars)
- Theme switcher: Light / Dark / Zen
- Per-day accent color and per-task color personalizations
- Styled toast notifications and confirmation modal
- Import/Export JSON backups

Clear Done behavior
- Use “Clear done” to remove completed tasks from the visible list while keeping them archived in the day.
- Archived tasks still count toward the day’s percentage and slices, so your progress doesn’t drop.

Backup
- Export: Top-right Export button downloads a JSON file with tasks, subtasks, accents, collapsed state, and theme.
- Import: Top-right Import button loads a JSON file and replaces your current data (you’ll be asked to confirm).

Personalization
- Pick an accent color per day (affects borders/gradients).
- Pick a color per task to color that task’s slice.

Notes
- Deadline is a free-form note (not a real date). Add/edit via the “Deadline” button on a task.
- Everything is stored locally in your browser. Clear your site storage to reset completely.
